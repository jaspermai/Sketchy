# Bread
**Bread** is a team formed for the Hack the North 2020++ weekend and the team behind the creation of **Sketchy**. The team consists of 4 members of different university backgrounds:
*Rosalyn Cheng* - 4th year Commerce student at Queen's University
*Terry Luan* - 2nd year Electrical & Computing Engineering student at University of Toronto
*Jasper Mai* - 2nd year Computer Science student at University of Toronto
*Jenny Vong* - 2nd year Mathematics student at University of Waterloo


# Sketchy

While there are many apps for doing sketches or jotting down notes (e.g. sketchpad.io and notepad.io), none of these applications provide quick access and they all require additional actions of operning a new webpage or tab. **Sketchy** is a Google Chrome Extension that allow users to quickly *sketch* down some drawings or notes. Users can use the application for any momentary ideas and save their canvas onto their computer as a .png or .jpg file for future access. 

Sketchy features a canvas with a pen tool, an eraser tool, and a tool to clear the canvas - all accessible with just **one click**. The thickness of the pen can be adjusted with the slider on the application and the sketches can be saved locally onto your computer.

Sketchy also features 3 different modes: Sketchy mode, Dark mode, and Rainbow mode. 

**Sketchy Mode** is the general mode, with simple colour schemes and a pen tool with the black colour.
**Dark Mode** is for those who prefer working with darker-coloured screens and looking for a white pen tool.
**Rainbow Mode** is created for those craving a cute mode to work on and wanting to sketch with a rainbow-coloured pen tool.


# Building Sketchy
Sketchy is built using primarily **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The user interface and logo were designed with **Figma**, while the backend interactiveness was accomplished through JavaScript. The team also worked with a *Canvas API*, which provided the starting blocks for the overall application.


# Future Expectations
In hopes of making students' lives EVEN better and more efficient, the team sees a ton of potential in this application for future implementations:
* Creating a transparent mode that will extend out of the canvas and allows users to draw directly on their current tab
* Allow users to send their sketches via messaging amd email platforms (e.g. Facebook Messenger, Gmail)
